Does Democrat credibility seem to be waning? Do any politicians aim to restore it? Most seem to prefer not to engage, giving the impression that that losing is what we do. Do any respond to these attacks vigorously. For me, one person stands out:

Others I like:

- [Adam Schiff](https://schiff.house.gov/about/biography). 
- [Jamie Raskin](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/ranking-member-raskin-s-statement-on-republicans-sham-impeachment-inquiry)
