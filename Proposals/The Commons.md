# The Commons

The idea here is a free-to-use repository of intellectual resources: ideas, inventions, processes, knowledge.

Scarcity is the norm. The common attitude is a reluctance to share, focusing instead on ways to make it pay. Think: money, recognition, regard, influence, excitement, stimulation. Could the commons do it better?

We are in an unprecedented level of thriving, many intellectual resources are not at all scarce, merely hoarded. Contributed instead to the commons, they become plentiful.

1. We need merely design it so that once established, it's self-sustaining. So that the compelling attraction is: everybody gains.

2. How does it get started? This is the hard part.
	1. Are there other projects like this?

3. We need to craft a policy that everyone will like. Subtleties abound.
	1. Does a "personal" ownership work, where sharing is negotiated?
	2. Could the commons track recognition and ignore ownership?
	3. Do contributors have greater access that freeloaders?
