# The Commons

The idea here is a free-to-use repository of intellectual resources: ideas, inventions, processes, knowledge.

Scarcity is the norm. The common attitude is a reluctance to share, focusing instead on ways to make it pay. Think: money, recognition, regard, influence, excitement, stimulation. Could the commons do it better? We are in an unprecedented period of thriving, many intellectual resources are not at all scarce, merely hoarded. Contributed instead to the commons, they become plentiful.

1. We need merely design it so that once established, it's self-sustaining. Subtleties abound.
	1. How do we design it so that everybody gains?
	2. Does a "personal" ownership work, where sharing is negotiated?
	3. Could the commons track recognition and ignore ownership?
	4. Do contributors have greater access than freeloaders?

2. How does it get started? This is the hard part.
	1. Are there other projects like this?
	2. What kind of funding would do the trick?
	3. Leave for later: trying to attract the hard cases.
