# Customer Feedback

While shopping online, and visiting a store, do you ever feel like something is a bit off? Maybe the sign up process is convoluted or the checkout requires you to log in first, but doesn't tell you? Crazy making little things that the designers and engineers didn't think about? Wouldn't they benefit from your feedback? Of course they would. Nevertheless, many online stores have no means of gathering your experience in a meaningful way. Some have myopic feedback questionnaires that are too narrowly focused to address your issue.

So the problem to solve is to create a ground swell of corporate interest in customer feedback and satisfaction.
