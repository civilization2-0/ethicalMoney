# Crowd sourced ideas
Some people want to own their ideas. Some wish to accrue respect or future income. Others wish to see their ideas gain influence and be recognized as the source.

We could characterize it as personal vs common property. If all ideas are unowned, the people described above will be reluctant to submit theirs, slowing the growth of the commons. Also, creating a policy that everyone will like is crazy hard. Possibly, however, we might come up with one. Let's try?
