# Certificate of Wisdom

i would love to see an education and certification regarding wisdom, to include the following:

• logical reasoning
• ethics
• [Non-Violent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/) 
• [metacurrency by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/metacurrency) 
• anything else worth teaching and certifying?

Obviously we need teachers, training material and means of measuring proficiency and of guaranteeing that graduates will indeed promulgate wisdom.
