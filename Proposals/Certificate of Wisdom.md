# Certificate of Wisdom

I would love to see an education and certification regarding wisdom, to include the following:

- logical reasoning  
- ethics  
- [Non-Violent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/)  
- [metacurrency by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/metacurrency)  
- anything else worth teaching and certifying?  

Once these certifications become known, they can add guidance about who is worth our attention and investment.

Obviously we need teachers, training material and means of measuring proficiency and of guaranteeing that graduates will indeed promulgate wisdom.
