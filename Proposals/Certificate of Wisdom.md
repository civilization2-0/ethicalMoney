# Certificate of Wisdom

I would love to see an education and certification regarding wisdom, to include the following:

- logical reasoning  
- ethics  
- [Non-Violent Communication](https://www.cnvc.org/)  
- [metacurrency by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/metacurrency)  
- anything else worth teaching and certifying

Once these certifications become accepted, they distinguish those worthy of our attention and collaboration. Plenty of needed infrastructure, especially a fool proof way to certify.
