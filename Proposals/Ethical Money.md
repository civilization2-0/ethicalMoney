# Ethical Money

Here is one proposal that is simple to say and unfathomably challenging. I think it would serve mankind and the planet more than anything else. Introduce ethics deeply and irrevocably into our monetary system. Make every transaction require an ethical sensibility. Shift some of the avarice on this planet towards wise, ethical, carefully considered activity.

Devise an ethical variant of money that is appealing enough to out compete what's in place?
