# Ethical Money

Here is one proposal that is simple to say and unfathomably challenging. I think it would serve mankind and the planet more than anything else. Introduce ethics deeply and irrevocably into our monetary system. Make every transaction require an ethical sensibility. Might we now have enough brain power on the planet to devise such a variant of money that is appealing enough to out compete the fiat now in place?

Cutting down forests would likely not be as common as it now is, in close relation to our growing global need for them to remain as a significant component of our world lungs.
