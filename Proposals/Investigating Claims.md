# Investigating Claims

Once upon a time, nature played with intelligence. She started with memory. Added language, tribal social complexity, civilization. Math, logic, meaning and ethics. A fascinating accomplishment. Every one of us is what resulted.

The conceit of consciousness also showed up: the idea that itâ€™s true because we think it, often just made up stuff. Public information is full of misleading fluff. This is the chink in our armor, maybe causing civilization to crumble, to let nature try again.

So the question here is: what intelligent strategy can help our species to care enough about investigating shit?
