# The Commons

The idea here is a free-to-use repository of intellectual resources: ideas, inventions, processes, knowledge.

Scarcity is the norm. The common attitude is a reluctance to share, focusing instead on ways to make it pay. Think: money, recognition, regard, influence, excitement, stimulation. Could the commons do it better? We are in an unprecedented period of thriving, many intellectual resources are not at all scarce, merely hoarded. Contributed instead to the commons, they become plentiful.
