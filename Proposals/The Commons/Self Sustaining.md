# Make it Self-Sustaining

We need merely design it so that once established, it's self-sustaining. Subtleties abound.

	1. How do we design it so that everybody gains?
	2. Does a "personal" ownership work, where sharing is negotiated?
	3. Could the commons track recognition and ignore ownership?
	4. Do contributors have greater access than freeloaders?
	5. How does the commons track value of contributions (money or something else)?
	6. How does authorship differ from ownership?
